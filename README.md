# Object-Oriented PHP

## Description

- Object-oriented programming places emphasis on the application’s objects and their interactions.
- An object can be thought of as a virtual representation of some real-world entity, such as an integer, spreadsheet, or form text field, bundling together the entity’s properties and behaviors into a singularly independent structure
- When embracing an object-oriented approach to developing applications, you’ll create these objects in such a way that when used together, they form the “world” your application is intended to represent.
- The advantages of such an approach are many, including enhanced code reusability, testability, and scalability.
- The reasoning behind why OOP bestows such advantages will become more apparent as you work through not only this and the following chapter, but also through much of the remainder of this book since an object oriented approach will be embraced whenever practical
